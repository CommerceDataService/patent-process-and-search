    "textdata": "The present application is being examined under the pre-AIA first to invent provisions.\n\n\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC § 112\n\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112(b):\n\n(b)  CONCLUSION.—The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA), second paragraph:\n\nThe specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\n\n\n\n\n\nClaims 1-4 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA), second paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor, or for pre-AIA the applicant regards as the invention.\n\nThe claims are toward a food product wherein its patentability is not dependent on its method of manufacture, and therefore it is unclear as to how the limitations “puffed up when heated” and “cooked by oil”, in claim 1, further limit the claims.\n\nAlso, a product claim is toward a composition at one point in time, therefore limitations toward some future state, such as “when” do not provide a patentable distinction, and it is unclear as to what they are imparting.\n\n\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC § 103\n\nThe following is a quotation of pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\n\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\n\n\n\n\n\nClaims 1-4 are rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Ray in view of Dove.\n\n\n\nRay: Loaded Baked Potato-and-Popcorn Mix; Racheal Ray Everyday, October 2010.\n\n\n\nDove: DOVE® Dark Chocolate Drizzled Potato Chips: Andrea Dopson Shipes; September 30, 2010 at 10:01am; https://www.facebook.com/notes/dove-chocolate/dove-dark-chocolate-drizzled-potato-chips/151232464915850.\n\n\n\nWith regard to the prior art the phrases “corn puffed up when heated” and “slices of potatoes cooked by oil” encompass, popcorn and potato chips.\n\nRay teaches methods of making snack food products comprising:\n\n10 cups freshly popped popcorn (about 80 grams –air cooked to 110 grams - oil popped);\n\n3 cups potato chips (about 85.2 grams fried to 102 grams baked);\n\n3 tablespoons salted butter (about 42.5 grams);\n\n2 teaspoons onion powder (about 2.29 grams);\n\n1/2 teaspoon sugar (about 2 grams);\n\n1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (about 0.85 grams);\n\n1/4 teaspoon salt (about 1.5 grams);\n\n1/2 cup finely grated aged cheddar or gouda cheese (about 62.5 grams); and\n\n3 tablespoons fresh or dried chopped chives (about 4 grams dry to 9.75 grams fresh).\n\nWhich equals a total weight of about 280 to 333.4 grams.\n\nSuch a teaching provides:\n\nabout 28.5 to 33 wt% popcorn; and\n\nabout 30 to 31 wt% potato chips.\n\nSuch a teaching encompasses the claim of:\n\nabout 15 to 45 wt% popcorn (i.e. corn puffed when heated), as in claim 1; and \n\nabout 30 to 40 wt% popcorn, as in claim 2.\n\n\n\nRay does not teach the claimed percentage of potato chips:\n\nabout 55 to 85 wt% potato chips (i.e. slices).\n\nDove also teaches methods teaches of making snack food products, and further provides that chips and popcorn can be substituted (see Andrea Dopson Shipes).\n\nSince a substitute is an alternative, replacement, or equivalent, it would be reasonable to expect that one of skill in the art has the skill to implement a predictable variation, such as the substitution of some of the popcorn, of Ray, for potato chips, because it is long known in the art of cooking to develop formulas based on the availability, taste, texture, personal preference, or a wide variety of other food variables.\n\nTherefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, at the time the invention was made, to modify the method of making snack foods including potato chips and popcorn, as Ray, to include a step comprising:\n\nabout 55 to 85 wt% potato chips (i.e. slices), as in claim 1;\n\nabout 60 to 70 wt% potato chips, as in claim 2; \n\nwherein both have substantially identical percentages by volume, as in claim 3; and\n\nwherein the potato chips have a wt% that is approximately twice that of the popcorn, as in claim 4;\n\nbecause Dove illustrates up to 100% chips and further provides that popcorn and chips are substitutes (i.e. alternatives, replacements, or equivalents), which provides one in the art with encompassing amounts of chips; further provides a reasonable expectation of success for achieving such predictable variations; and furthermore it is long known in the art of cooking to develop such formulas based on the availability, taste, texture, personal preference, or a wide variety of other ingredient variables.\n\n\n\nIn summary, applicant claims a formula for making snack food products that use common ingredients, which does not amount to invention in the constantly developing art of preparing food because there is no specific showing that establishes a coaction or cooperative relationship between the selected ingredients which produces a new, unexpected and useful function.  \n\nFurther, attention is invited to In re Levin, 84 USPQ 232 and the cases cited therein, which are considered in point in fact situation of this specific instant case.  \n\nAt page 234, the Court stated as follows:\n\nThis court has taken the position that new recipes or formulas for cooking food which involve the addition or elimination of common ingredients, or for treating them in ways which differ from the former practice, do not amount to invention, merely because it is not disclosed that, in the constantly developing art of preparing food, no one else ever did the particular thing upon which the applicant asserts his right to a patent.  In all such cases, there is nothing patentable unless the applicant by a proper showing further establishes a coaction or cooperative relationship between the selected ingredients which produces a new, unexpected and useful function.  In re Benjamin D. White, 17 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 956, 39 F.2d 974, 5 USPQ 267; In re Mason et al., 33 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1144, 156 F.2d 189, 70 USPQ 221.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe prior art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to applicant's disclosure: MyRecipes, IDMGF (in skippydel13KYzone6), Carey (4,950087), Eini (6,348,229), Woelfel (2006/0204625), and Border (2007/0014914) all  illustrates the commonly known snack food mixtures of  popcorn and potato chips.\n\n\n\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the examiner should be directed to PATRICIA GEORGE whose telephone number is (571)272-5955.
