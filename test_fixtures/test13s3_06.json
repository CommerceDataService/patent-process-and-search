Due to this communication, claims 16-28 are currently presented in the instant application.  Note that the pronoun \u201cone\u201d will henceforth refer to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention.\n\nNotice of Pre-AIA or AIA Status\n\n1. The present application is being examined under the pre-AIA first to invent provisions. \n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \u00a7 112\n\n2. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112(b):\n\n(b)  CONCLUSION.\u2014The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA), second paragraph:\n\nThe specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Claim 22 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA), second paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor, or for pre-AIA the applicant regards as the invention.\n\nWith respect to Claim 22, line 4, \u201csaid land\u201d lacks antecedent basis.  It is unclear if claim 22 was supposed to depend from claim 19 where the limitation would have proper antecedent basis.  The examiner will interpret claim 22 as depending from claim 19.\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \u00a7 103\n\n4. The following is a quotation of pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\n\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Claims 16-26 are rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over applicant cited Schultz, J. et al., A CONTINOUS WAVE TRANSMISSION METHOD FOR THE ULTRASONIC SPECTROMETRY OF LIQUIDS, Measurement Science and Technology, IOP, Bristol, GB, Vol. 9, No. 8, August 1, 1998, hereinafter Schultz in view of Gehring (U.S. Publication No. 2009/0173158)\n\nWith respect to Claim 16, Schultz discloses an apparatus (see figure 4) for carrying out measurements of an analyte fluid, comprising: a housing [2]; a measurement chamber [1] arranged in said housing; a first resonator [4b]; a second resonator [4a]; said resonators delimit said measurement chamber in areas; said first and said second resonator are constructed as first and second oscillating quartz units (see page 1269 section 3), respectively; said first and second oscillating quartz units include an oscillating quartz surface; said first and second oscillating quartz units delimit said measurement chamber with reference to the direction of gravity (see figure 4); said first oscillating quartz unit resides at the top of said housing and said second oscillating quartz unit resides at the bottom of said housing; said housing is rotatable (note that while not explicit teaching regarding rotating in the prior art, the entire device could be rotated.  Therefore the limitation can be met without structural modification of Schultz) about a rotating axis perpendicular to the direction of gravity; and, said housing rotatable about at least 180 degrees.  Schultz does not disclose conduits for inputting and outputting media to and from said measurement chamber.\n\nGehring discloses a similar apparatus (see figure 1) that uses conduits for inputting [34] and outputting [35] media to and from said measurement chamber.\n\nIt would be obvious to one that the fluid have to get into Schultz\u2019s chamber somehow and Gehring teaches a common solution that beneficially moves the fluid into the chamber without the need for external fluid moving means.  Note that further citations will refer to Schultz unless otherwise noted.\n\nWith respect to Claim 17, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an apparatus according to claim 16, but neither specifically disclose that said first and/or second oscillating quartz units are removably connected to said measurement chamber.  However, barring criticality, one would view this as a case of making separable as per MPEP 2144.04 V-C.  One would find making seperable beneficial as it would allow easy repair in the case of a single quartz unit failure.\n\n\tWith respect to Claim 18, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an apparatus according to claim 16, wherein said oscillating quartz surfaces facing said measurement chamber have the same electrical potential (note that while not explicitly stated, the two quartz surfaces are identical by every indication in Schultz).\n\n\tWith respect to Claim 19, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an apparatus according to claim 16, further comprising ring foil (see Gehring figure 1, 6) and wherein said measurement chamber includes a land [see Gehring 10], and, said ring foil engages said land of said measurement chamber.\n\n\tWith respect to Claim 20, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an apparatus according to claim 19, wherein said land is arranged in parallel (see Gehring figure 1) to said oscillating quartz unit completely surrounding said measurement chamber.\n\n\tWith respect to Claim 21, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an apparatus according to claim 19, wherein said land includes the conduits for inputting (see Gehring figure 1, 34) and outputting (see Gehring figure 1, 35) of media for said measurements in the measurement chamber.\n\n\tWith respect to Claim 22, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an\n\napparatus according to claim 16, wherein said oscillating quartz units are supported in supporting means (see figure 4, section around 4a/b) radially surrounding said oscillating quartz units, and, a sealing means [5a,b] resides between said supporting means of said oscillating quartz units, in particular between said supporting means and said land of said housing.\n\n\tWith respect to Claim 23, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an\n\napparatus according to claim 22, wherein said sealing means is applied in the form of a layer (see figure 4) on said supporting means.\n\n\tWith respect to Claim 24, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an apparatus according to claim 23, wherein said layer is made out of polydimethylsiloxane (note that this is a common form of silicon rubber).\n\n\tWith respect to Claim 25, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an\n\napparatus according to claim 2 4, wherein at least one conduit to said measurement chamber extends (see Gehring figure 4) through said measurement chamber housing.\n\n\tWith respect to Claim 26, the combination of Schultz and Gehring disclose an\n\napparatus according to claim 16, wherein said first oscillating quartz unit is secured in said housing by means of a closure mechanism [5a/b].\n\nAllowable Subject Matter\n\n6. Claims 27 and 28 are allowed.\n\n7. The following is an examiner\u2019s statement of reasons for allowance: Many of the structural limitations are seen in the rejection above, but the combination of specific steps to determine the mass distribution is neither anticipated nor obviated by the prior art.\n\nAny comments considered necessary by applicant must be submitted no later than the payment of the issue fee and, to avoid processing delays, should preferably accompany the issue fee.  Such submissions should be clearly labeled \u201cComments on Statement of Reasons for Allowance.\u201d\n\nInquiry\n\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the examiner should be directed to ALEX DEVITO whose telephone number is (571)270-7551.
