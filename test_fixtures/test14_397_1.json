Restriction\n\nThis application contains the following inventions or groups of inventions which are not so linked as to form a single general inventive concept under PCT Rule 13.1. \n\nIn accordance with 37 CFR 1.499, applicant is required, in reply to this action, to elect a single invention to which the claims must be restricted.\n\nGroup I, claim(s) 1-12 and 19, drawn to a collagen material.\n\n\n\nGroup II, claim(s) 13-18, drawn to a method of producing a collagen material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Election of Species\n\nThis application contains claims directed to more than one species of the generic invention. These species are deemed to lack unity of invention because they are not so linked as to form a single general inventive concept under PCT Rule 13.1. \n\nThe species are as follows: \n\nEpidermal growth factor (EGF), Insulin- like growth factor (IGF), Transforming growth factor (TGF), Nerve growth factor (NGF), Brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Vesicular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), Granulocyte- macrophage- colony stimulating factor (GM-CSP), Plateletderived growth factor (PDGF), Erythropoietin (EPO), Thrombopoietin (TPO), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF2), or Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).\n\nApplicant is required, in reply to this action, to elect a single species to which the claims shall be restricted if no generic claim is finally held to be allowable. The reply must also identify the claims readable on the elected species, including any claims subsequently added. An argument that a claim is allowable or that all claims are generic is considered non-responsive unless accompanied by an election.\n\nUpon the allowance of a generic claim, applicant will be entitled to consideration of claims to additional species which are written in dependent form or otherwise require all the limitations of an allowed generic claim. Currently, the following claim(s) are generic:  1 and 8.\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENT FOR UNITY OF INVENTION\n\n\n\nAs provided in 37 CFR 1.475(a), a national stage application shall relate to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept (\"requirement of unity of invention\"). Where a group of inventions is claimed in a national stage application, the requirement of unity of invention shall be fulfilled only when there is a technical relationship among those inventions involving one or more of the same or corresponding special technical features. The expression \"special technical features\" shall mean those technical features that define a contribution which each of the claimed inventions, considered as a whole, makes over the prior art.\n\nThe determination whether a group of inventions is so linked as to form a single general inventive concept shall be made without regard to whether the inventions are claimed in separate claims or as alternatives within a single claim. See 37 CFR 1.475(e).\n\nWHEN CLAIMS ARE DIRECTED TO MULTIPLE CATEGORIES OF INVENTIONS\n\nAs provided in 37 CFR 1.475(b), a national stage application containing claims to different categories of invention will be considered to have unity of invention if the claims are drawn only to one of the following combinations of categories:\n\n(1) A product and a process specially adapted for the manufacture of said product; or\n\n(2) A product and process of use of said product; or\n\n(3) A product, a process specially adapted for the manufacture of the said product, and a use of the said product; or\n\n(4) A process and an apparatus or means specifically designed for carrying out the said process;\n\nor\n\n(5) A product, a process specially adapted for the manufacture of the said product, and an apparatus or means specifically designed for carrying out the said process.\n\nOtherwise, unity of invention might not be present. See 37 CFR 1.475(c).\n\n\n\nWhere such a combination of categories of inventions is claimed in a national stage application, the requirement of unity of invention shall be fulfilled only when there is a technical relationship among those inventions involving one or more of the same or corresponding special technical features. The expression \"special technical features\" is defined in Rule 13.2 as meaning those technical features that define a contribution which each of the inventions, considered as a whole, makes over the prior art. Otherwise, unity of invention might not be present. See 37 CFR 1.475(c).\n\n\n\nThe groups of inventions listed above do not relate to a single general inventive concept under PCT Rule 13.1 because, under PCT Rule 13.2, they lack the same or corresponding special technical features for the following reasons:\n\nGroups I and II constitute an approved group, i.e. a product and a process specially adapted for the manufacture of said product, and thus have unity of invention a priori.\n\nHowever, Groups I and II do not share unity of invention a posteriori because the groups of inventions listed above do not relate to a single general inventive concept under PCT Rule 13.1 because, under PCT Rule 13.2, they lack the same or corresponding special technical features for the following reasons:\n\nAlthough the inventions of Group I and II require the technical feature of a collagen gel fragment, this technical feature is not a special technical feature as it does not make a contribution over the prior art in view of Torbet et al., (WO 2008/034854 A1, 2008 \u2013 from IDS dated 8/19/2013). Torbet et al. teach a synthetic multi-layer structure comprising biopolymer that includes a collagen gel sheet (collagen gel fragments). See Title and page 4, lines 4-10 and page 19, lines 19-27. Thus, the shared technical feature does not provide a contribution over the art, so unity of invention is lacking.\n\n\n\nApplicant is advised that the reply to this requirement to be complete must include (i) an election of a species or invention to be examined even though the requirement may be traversed (37 CFR 1,143) and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected invention,\n\nThe election of an invention or species may be made with or without traverse. To preserve a right to petition, the election must be made with traverse. If the reply does not distinctly and specifically point out supposed errors in the restriction requirement, the election shall be treated as an election without traverse. Traversal must be presented at the time of election in order to be considered timely. Failure to timely traverse the requirement will result in the loss of right to petition under 37 CFR 1.144. If claims are added after the election, applicant must indicate which of these claims are readable on the elected invention or species.\n\nShould applicant traverse on the ground that the inventions have unity of invention (37 CFR 1.475(a)), applicant must provide reasons in support thereof. Applicant may submit evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing the inventions to be obvious variants or clearly admit on the record that this is the case. Where such evidence or admission is provided by applicant, if the examiner finds one of the inventions unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or admission may be used in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) of the other invention.\n\nApplicant is reminded that upon the cancellation of claims to a non-elected invention, the inventorship must be amended in compliance with 37 CFR 1.48(b) if one or more of the currently named inventors is no longer an inventor of at least one claim remaining in the application. Any amendment of inventorship must be accompanied by a request under 37 CFR 1.48(b) and by the fee required under 37 CFR 1.17(i).\n\nThe examiner has required restriction between product or apparatus claims and process claims. Where applicant elects claims directed to the product/apparatus, and all product/apparatus claims are subsequently found allowable, withdrawn process claims that include all the limitations of the allowable product/apparatus claims should be considered for rejoinder. All claims directed to a nonelected process invention must include all the limitations of an allowable product/apparatus claim for that process invention to be rejoined.\n\nIn the event of rejoinder, the requirement for restriction between the product/apparatus claims and the rejoined process claims will be withdrawn, and the rejoined process claims will be fully examined for patentability in accordance with 37 CFR 1.104. Thus, to be allowable, the rejoined claims must meet all criteria for patentability including the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 101,102, 103 and 112. Until all claims to the elected product/apparatus are found allowable, an otherwise proper restriction requirement between product/apparatus claims and process claims may be maintained. Withdrawn process claims that are not commensurate in scope with an allowable product/apparatus claim will not be rejoined. See MPEP \u00a7 821.04. Additionally, in order for rejoinder to occur, applicant is advised that the process claims should be amended during prosecution to require the limitations of the product/apparatus claims. Failure to do so may result in no rejoinder. Further, note that the prohibition against double patenting rejections of 35 U.S.C. 121 does not apply where the restriction requirement is withdrawn by the examiner before the patent issues. See MPEP \u00a7 804.01.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the examiner should be directed to  whose telephone number is (571)270-5523.
