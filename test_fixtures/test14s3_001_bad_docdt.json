This Office Action has been issued in response to amendment filed on 19th October 2015.\n\nClaims 7 \u2013 9 and 12 as amended are pending.\n\nApplicant's arguments filed 19th October have been fully considered but they are not persuasive.  This Action is made FINAL.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe title of the invention is not descriptive.  A new title is required that is clearly indicative of the invention to which the claims are directed.  While applicant\u2019s title describes the invention in a broad sense, a detailed title would be useful in its informative value in indexing, classifying and searching.\n\nThe following title is suggested: \u201cRestricting access to sensitive data in system memory dumps utilizing header indicators and allowing access based on cipher\u201d.\n\nClaim Objections\n\nClaim 7 is objected to because of the following informalities.\n\nRegarding claim 7, \u201cthat secure memory\u201d in line 7 appears to lack antecedent basis.  Examiner suggests amending to \u201cthat the secure memory\u201d.\n\nAppropriate correction is required.\n\n\n\nDouble Patenting\n\nThe nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the \u201cright to exclude\u201d granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees.  A nonstatutory double patenting rejection is appropriate where the claims at issue are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); and In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).\n\nA timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d) may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory double patenting ground provided the reference application or patent either is shown to be commonly owned with this application, or claims an invention made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. A terminal disclaimer must be signed in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(b).\n\nThe USPTO internet Web site contains terminal disclaimer forms which may be used.  Please visit http://www.uspto.gov/forms/.  The filing date of the application will determine what form should be used.  A web-based eTerminal Disclaimer may be filled out completely online using web-screens. An eTerminal Disclaimer that meets all requirements is auto-processed and approved immediately upon submission.  For more information about eTerminal Disclaimers, refer to http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/file/efs/guidance/eTD-info-I.jsp.  \n\nClaims 7 \u2013 9 and 12 of instant application discloses a system while claims 1 \u2013 3, 6 \u2013 9 and 12 of copending Application 14/501,179 respectively discloses a method and a computer program product.  It would have been obvious at the time the invention was filed to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains to implement a system utilizing the method and computer program product of copending application because it allows for method and computer program product to be deployed in a system.\n\nThis is a provisional nonstatutory double patenting rejection because the patentably indistinct claims have not in fact been patented.\n\nFor example,\n\n\n\nCurrent application\n\nCopending Application 14/501,179\n\n7.

The computer program product of claim 7, the method further comprising referencing each sensitive data object in the secure memory object with a tag in a reference table\n\n\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \u00a7 103\n\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\n\nA patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically disclosed as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains.  Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which the invention was made.\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim 7 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Bank (US 20080126301) in view of Kelly (US 20070255912) and Fedtke (US 20090282036).\n\n\n\nRegarding claim 7, Examiner is interpreting the claimed, \u201csecure memory object,\u201d as segments of system memory that can only be accessed using a cipher provided by the data owner as per \u00b6[20] of instant specification.\n\nBank teaches\n\nA computer system for restricting access to sensitive data in system memory dumps, comprising: \n\na memory (\u00b6[22]  a random access memory (RAM)) having computer readable computer instructions and a processor for executing (\u00b6[25]  These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor) the computer readable instructions (\u00b6[20]  a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium) to perform a method comprising:\n\ndesignating that secure memory object (information) should be included in a system memory dump (\u00b6[42], [47]  the core dump processing application can generate one or more lists 38, e.g., of address information such as ranges, where sensitive information may be altered and address ranges where sensitive information should not be altered.  Sensitive information in the core dump copy should be altered, e.g., masked, concealed, erased.  Alteration of sensitive information using erasing implies the information is excluded, while altering using masking (not erasing) implies the information is included.)\n\nincluding the secure memory object in the system memory dump based on a designation (address information) that the secure memory object should be included (\u00b6[42]  the core dump processing application can generate one or more lists 38, e.g., of address information such as ranges, and address ranges where sensitive information should not be altered.  Not altering the information implies retaining the information)\n\nBank does not appear to teach\n\ndesignating that the memory object containing sensitive data as a secure memory object\n\nenabling display of the system memory dump by way of a formatting tool\n\nusing the formatting tool to prevent display of the secure memory object in the system memory dump in absence of a cipher; and\n\nrestricting access to the secure memory object by programs other than the formatting tool\n\nHowever, Kelly teaches\n\ndesignating that the memory object (non-dumpable memory region) containing sensitive data (secret data) as a secure memory object (non-dumpable memory region) (\u00b6[32]  the OS encrypts the data in the memory regions that are marked as non-dumpable. The encrypted data is then dumped to the non-volatile storage medium at step 570.  If the encrypted data is required for troubleshooting, the OS administrator may provide the vendor with the encryption key to decrypt the data.  Kelly teaches that the non-dumplable memory region is encrypted before dumping to non-volatile storage.  As such the non-dumpable data is not readable because it is encrypted unless an encryption key is provided) (\u00b6[28]  If the object contains secret data, the object is marked on the disk as being secret. When the cache subsystem loads the data from the disk into memory, it marks the memory areas into which the object data is read as non-dumpable)\n\n\n\nBank and Kelly are analogous art because they are in the same field of endeavor, memory management.\n\nIt would have been obvious at the time the invention was filed to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains to use the memory region definition method of Kelly in Bank\u2019s system because it reduces the risk of disclosing secret information during troubleshooting by eliminating secret information from the dump (\u00b6[5]).\n\nBank in view of Kelly do not appear to teach\n\nenabling display of the system memory dump by way of a formatting tool\n\nusing the formatting tool to prevent display of the secure memory object in the system memory dump in absence of a cipher; and\n\nrestricting access to the secure memory object by programs other than the formatting tool\n\nHowever, Fedtke teaches\n\nenabling display of the system memory dump (anonymized dump log) by way of a formatting tool (Fig. 8  DALA utility GUI 801) (\u00b6[89]  DATA utility 801 includes a DALA browser 803, a knowledge base editor 804, and a DALA undo utility 820 which may be implemented as part of undo utility 608 of FIG. 6A  DALA browser 803 allows a user to browse information stored in storage 802 such as anonymized dump/log files 807 efficiently)\n\nusing the formatting tool to prevent display of the secure memory object (confidential information) in the system memory dump in absence of a cipher (\u00b6[80], [84], [89]  the confidential information may be encrypted using a variety of encryption methods such that the recipient cannot recover the confidential information without a decryption key.  The owner will then send the FAO-related undo parameters including the encryption method(s), key(s) etc. This information will be passed to the DALA undo utility 608 to make the selected portion(s) visible by creating a new version of the anonymized dump file 609 with the original confidential data.  DALA browser 803 allows a user to browse information stored in storage 802 such as anonymized dump/log files 807 efficiently, namely in combination/relation with the log files 808-811. It makes all anonymized areas and DALA details, such as FAOs, etc. easily accessible and highly transparent.  Fedtke teaches anonymized areas are visible but encrypted.  While the anonymized areas are visible, confidential information is not visible in the tool unless a key is used to decrypt the anonymized areas.)\n\nrestricting access to the secure memory object by programs other than the formatting tool (\u00b6[4], [20]  a utility application designed to process the original dump file can still process the anonymized dump file without exposing the identified content of the original dump file to the dump file recipient.  DALA also includes a component to prevent any system and/or software environment from providing and/or creating dump/log files that are accessible by regular users of a computer.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that utility not designed to process the dump file would not be able to access the dump file which includes anonymized areas containing encrypted sensitive information.  Utility application can access dump files while non-utility cannot access the dump files)\n\n\n\nBank, Kelly and Fedtke are analogous art because they are in the same field of endeavor, memory management.\n\nIt would have been obvious at the time the invention was filed to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains to use the anonymization technique of Fedtke in Bank\u2019s system because anonymization of certain information within a file for security purposes improves security (\u00b6[3]).\n\nClaims 8 \u2013 9 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Bank in view of Kelly and Fedtke, and in further view of Wong (US 20070113028).\n\nRegarding claim 8, Kelly teaches\n\nThe computer system of claim 7, wherein the defining of the secure memory object further comprises setting an attribute\u2026 (\u00b6[25]  A non-dumpable attribute database 315 is maintained to indicate which memory regions in memory 313 are marked as non-dumpable.  Alternatively, non-dumpable attributes may be maintained in main memory)\n\nBank in view of Kelly and Fedtke do not appear to teach\n\n\u2026setting an attribute in a header of the memory object\n\nHowever, Wong teaches\n\n\u2026setting an attribute in a header of the memory object (\u00b6[24], [25]  the SS data object 204 according to an embodiment of the present invention includes an SS data object header 210 and an SS data object data area 212.  The \"WRITING_HDR\" state indicates that the data object header is in the process of being written.)\n\n\n\nBank, Kelly, Fedtke and Wong are analogous art because they are in the same field of endeavor, memory management.\n\nIt would have been obvious at the time the invention was filed to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains to the header management method of Wong in Bank's system because the information in the SS data object header 210 and the data instance header 221 are used by various processes of the FDM in managing the data objects, improving performance (\u00b6[30]).\n\nRegarding claim 9, Bank teaches\n\nThe computer system of claim 7, wherein the designating further comprises setting an attribute\u2026 (\u00b6[59]  A status code may also be provided for the address ranges to distinguish addresses that are either designated to be overwritten or should be protected from overwriting)\n\nBank in view of Kelly and Fedtke do not appear to teach\n\n\u2026setting an attribute in a header of the memory object\n\nHowever, Wong teaches\n\n\u2026setting an attribute in a header of the memory object (\u00b6[24], [25]  the SS data object 204 according to an embodiment of the present invention includes an SS data object header 210 and an SS data object data area 212.  The \"WRITING_HDR\" state indicates that the data object header is in the process of being written.)\n\nBank, Kelly, Fedtke and Wong are analogous art because they are in the same field of endeavor, memory management.\n\nIt would have been obvious at the time the invention was filed to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains to the header management method of Wong in Bank's system because the information in the SS data object header 210 and the data instance header 221 are used by various processes of the FDM in managing the data objects, improving performance (\u00b6[30]).\n\nClaim 12 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Bank in view of Kelly and Fedtke, and in further view of Van Riel (US 20070208954).\n\nRegarding claim 12, Bank in view of Kelly and Fedtke do not appear to teach\n\nThe computer system of claim 7, further comprising referencing each sensitive data object in the secure memory object with a tag in a reference table\n\nHowever, Van Riel teaches\n\nThe computer system of claim 7, further comprising referencing each sensitive data object in the secure memory object (Fig. 2  confidential area 212) with a tag (virtual page frame number) in a reference table (Fig. 2  page table 208) (\u00b6[24]  Page table 208 provides a mapping between the virtual address space of virtual memory 202 and the physical address space of memory 110.  page table 208 is accessed by extracting the virtual page frame number and offset of the desired data. The virtual page frame number serves as an index to page table 208 to retrieve a physical page frame number. The physical address may then be determined by multiplying the page size by the physical page frame number and adding the offset)\n\n\n\nBank, Kelly, Fedtke and Van Riel are analogous art because they are in the same field of endeavor, memory management.\n\nIt would have been obvious at the time the invention was filed to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains to use the confidential area allocation method of Van Riel in Bank\u2019s system because contents of the physical memory that correspond to data allocated to the confidential area of the virtual memory are identified and are then protected, improving security (\u00b6[8]).\n\nResponse to Arguments\n\nApplicant's arguments filed 19th October 2015 have been fully considered but they are not persuasive.\n\nII. Objection to the Specification\n\nIn response to applicant\u2019s arguments that \u201cutilizing header indicators\u201d feature is not recited in the independent claim, Examiner respectfully disagrees.  While the feature is not recited in independent claim, a detailed title would be useful in its informative value in indexing, classifying and searching.\n\nIV. Claim Rejections Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7103(a)\n\nApplicant\u2019s arguments with respect to claim have been considered but are moot because the arguments do not apply to any of the references being used in the current rejection.\n\nApplicant\u2019s arguments that Bank in view of Kelly do not appear to teach \u201cprevent[s] display of the secure memory object, and that access by other programs is restricted\u201d have been considered but are moot because the arguments do not apply to reference Fedtke used in the current rejection necessitated by amendment.\n\n\n\nDependent claims are rejected as noted supra.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe prior art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to applicant's disclosure. \n\n\uf0b7 Jordan (US 20110145596) teaches restricting access to protected areas by other programs which may be relevant to claim 7.\n\nApplicant's amendment necessitated the new ground(s) of rejection presented in this Office action.  Accordingly, THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL.  See MPEP \u00a7 706.07(a).  Applicant is reminded of the extension of time policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).  \n\nA shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of this action.  In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing date of this final action and the advisory action is not mailed until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to 37 CFR 1.136(a) will be calculated from the mailing date of the advisory action.  In no event, however, will the statutory period for reply expire later than SIX MONTHS from the date of this final action. \n\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the examiner should be directed to CHIE YEW whose telephone number is (571)270-5282.  The examiner can normally be reached on Monday - Thursday and alternate Fridays.\n\n\n\nIf attempts to reach the examiner by telephone are unsuccessful, the examiner\u2019s supervisor, Christian Chace can be reached on (571) 272-4190.
