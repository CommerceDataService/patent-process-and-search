  "textdata": "DETAILED ACTION\n\n1. This action is in response to original filings on 6/17/2011. Claims 1-19 are pending.\n\nDouble Patenting\n\nThe nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the \u201cright to exclude\u201d granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees.   A nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting rejection is appropriate where the conflicting claims are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); and  In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).\n\nA timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d) may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory double patenting ground provided the conflicting application or patent either is shown to be commonly owned with this application, or claims an invention made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. \n\nEffective January 1, 1994, a registered attorney or agent of record may sign a terminal disclaimer. A terminal disclaimer signed by the assignee must fully comply with 37 CFR 3.73(b).\n\nClaims 7 -12, 16, 17 and 18 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 5, 22 and 23 of U.S. Patent No.8,055,910.  Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from each other because both sets of claims disclose varying the quality of the content played black by the device based on a verification process and applying countermeasures. \n\n\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC \u00a7 103\n\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\n\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.  Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\n\n\n\nClaims 1-6 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Morrison et al. (US Patent Publication No. 2003/0018895) in view of Isnardi (US Patent No. 6,687,384).\n\n\n\nAs to claim 1, Morrison teaches a method of distributing audiovisual content intended for secure playback, comprising:  \n\n(a) modifying at least a portion of the audiovisual content to thereby corrupt the video (i.e., \u2026teaches the forensic identifier after being created is encoded into the audio track of a motion picture [par. 168]); \n\n(b) generating program logic associated with the modified content (i.e., \u2026teaches  The DVD players suitable for this example would include a component that provides the continuous decoding of the encoded motion picture data, using as the forensic identifier the identifier attached to the media [par. 171]), \n\n(c) distributing the modified content (i.e., \u2026teaches distribution to a confined class of authorized users, each of which will possess a device having the components [par. 171]); and \n\n(d) distributing the program logic (i.e., \u2026teaches a binary key can be generated, embedded in a circuit and physically attached to the medium [par. 138]).\n\n\n\nMorrison does not expressly teach:\n\nthe program logic adapted to correct a modification applied in step (a); The Examiner notes applicant's paragraph 309 where the applicant discloses undoing the forensic modification (e.g., watermarking). The Examiner notes in this instance Isnardi discloses undo (e.g., data remover) watermarking of the video stream. See column 13, lines 10-30. Therefore given the system disclosed above by Morrison, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have recognized the advantage of modifying the system to enhance data stream security by employing the Isnardi\u2018s method of embedding forensic data into a data stream.  \n\n\n\nAs to claim 2, Morrison teaches a method where: (a) steps (c) and (d) are performed together by distributing the modified content and program logic on a common optical disc [par. 49]; \n\nand (b) generating program logic includes generating program logic further adapted to interrogate (e.g., authenticate) playback environment [abstract]. \n\n\n\nAs to claim 3, Morrison teaches a method where generating program logic includes generating program logic adapted to apply one of a plurality of substitutions to correct modification of said video, said substitution being selected based on information characterizing said playback device [par. 54 & 55]. \n\n\n\nAs to claim 4, Morrison teaches a method where: (a) said method further comprises encrypting at least a portion of said program logic with a key derived using at least one key associated with a specific playback device seeking to play content (i.e., ... teaches the data comprising the work can be encoded using an appropriate encoding algorithm in conjunction with a forensic identifier in the form of a binary key [par. 171]); \n\nand (b) distributing said program logic includes distributing any portions thereof which have been encrypted using at least one key associated with said specific playback device [par. 46 & par. 51]. \n\n\n\nAs to claim 5, Morrison teaches a method further comprising: (a) configuring the program logic to accept information from a user (i.e., \u2026teaches a user purchases the desired movie through the set top box.  The process begins by first probing the set top box for information needed to generate a forensic identifier [par. 55]); and\n\n (b) configuring the program logic to use said information to derive a key necessary for correcting modification of said audiovisual content (i.e., ... teaches the rendering device will use the forensic identifier to decode the data [par. 55]). \n\n\n\nAs to claim 6, Morrison teaches a method further comprising configuring the program logic to cause a player device to access a server over a network (e.g., online [par. 54]).\n\n\n\n9. Claim 19 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Oom Temudo de Castro et al. (US Patent Publication No. 2004/0111608 and Oom hereinafter) in view of Asano (US Patent Publication No.US 2002/0152387).\n\n\n\nAs to claim 19, Oom teaches a method for verifying the integrity of encrypted audiovisual content on an optical medium, comprising: (a) performing hashes of portions of said encrypted audiovisual content (i.e., \u2026teaches primary data stream contains a file that is divided into multiple blocks.  \u2026 teaches each block is encrypted using a symmetric cipher (e.g., RC4) and a hash of the block as the encryption key [par. 56]).; (b) creating a hash tree from said hashes by hashing multiple of said hashes together (i.e., \u2026teaches a tree structures [par. 57 & 58]); and (c) digitally signing said hash tree such that said signature can be verified by a playback device seeking to playback said audiovisual content (i.e., \u2026teaches verify a block of the file, the file system optionally evaluates the signature on whole file verification value (if one exists), checks that the whole-file verification value matches the hash of the root block, metadata header and user information and then traverses the tree to the appropriate leaf node associated with a target block to be verified.  \u2026 teaches the file system hashes the target block and if the hash matches the access value contained in the leaf node, the block is authentic [par. 59]). \n\n\n\nOom does not expressly teach:\n\n\tsignature verification at the playback device. However in this instance the Examiner notes the teachings of prior art reference Asano. Asano discloses signature verification at the playback device. See paragraph 268. Therefore given the system disclosed above by Oom, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have recognized the advantage of modifying the system to enhance content playback security by employing Asano\u2019s capability to verify digital signature related information at the playback device. \n\n\n\nAllowable Subject Matter\n\nThe Examiner notes the above double patenting rejection of independent claim 10 and dependent claims 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 and 18. The Examiner notes that independent claim 10 would be allowable over the prior art upon formal filing and office approval of a Terminal Disclaimer. Dependent claims 11, 12, 16, 17 and 18 would also be allowable if independent claim 10 is allowable. \n\nThe Examiner notes that clams 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.\n\nAs allowable subject matter has been indicated, applicant's reply must either comply with all formal requirements or specifically traverse each requirement not complied with.  See 37 CFR 1.111(b) and MPEP \u00a7 707.07(a).\n\n\n\nContact Information\n\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the examiner should be directed to BRYAN WRIGHT whose telephone number is (571)270-3826.  The examiner can normally be reached on 8:30 am - 5:30 pm Monday -Friday.\n\nIf attempts to reach the examiner by telephone are unsuccessful, the examiner\u2019s supervisor, Flynn Nathan can be reached on (571) 272-1915.
