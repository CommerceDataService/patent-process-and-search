STATEMENT OF THE CASE 

 This proceeding arose from a request by Symantec Corporation for an 

inter partes reexamination of U.S. Patent 6,480,962 B1, entitled “System 

and Method for Protecting a Client During Runtime from Hostile 

Downloadables” (the ’962 patent). Patent Owner and Requester both note 

related litigation. See PO App. Br. 1, Third Party Requester Respondent’s 

Brief (3PR Resp. Br.) 4. The ’962 patent relates to “a system and method for 

protecting clients from hostile Downloadables.” ’962 patent, col. 1, ll. 22–

23. Claim 22 is illustrative are reproduced below: 

 22. A system for determining whether a 
Downloadable, which is received by a Downloadable engine, is 
suspicious, comprising: 
 means for monitoring substantially in parallel a plurality 
of subsystems of the operating system during runtime for an 
event caused from a request made by a Downloadable; 
 means for interrupting processing of the request; 
 means for comparing information pertaining to the 
Downloadable against a predetermined security policy; and 
 means for performing a predetermined responsive action 
based on the comparison.

ANALYSIS 

THE ANTICIPATION REJECTION OF CLAIMS 2, 3, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 22–24, 

26, 27, 29, 32, 34, 35, 40, 43, 44, 46–51, 53, AND 54 BY JAEGER 

 The Examiner finds claims 2, 3, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 22–24, 26, 27, 

29, 32, 34, 35, 40, 43, 44, 46–51, 53, and 54 are invalid under 35 U.S.C. 

§ 102(a) as anticipated by Jaeger (Trent Jaeger, et al., “Building Systems 

that Flexibly Control Downloaded Executable Content,” PROCEEDINGS OF 

THE SIXTH USENIX UNIX SECURITY SYMPOSIUM, July 1996). RAN 14, 34–

36, 63–64 (incorporating Request 31–32 and Claim Chart Exhibit C1 by 

reference). 

 

Claims 2, 3, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 22–24, 26, 27, 29, 32, 34, 35, 40, 43, and 

48–51 

 Patent Owner presents the following principal arguments: 

Nowhere does Jaeger show or suggest MONITORING as 
variously claimed in independent claims 1, 12, 22, 33, 48, and 
50. In stark contrast, Jaeger discloses that operations within the 
browser “are implemented by a call to authorize which checks 
the content access rights prior to calling the actual operation. 
Since these commands are only available in the browser and are 
protected by the authorization operation, only authorized 
accesses to system objects are possible.” See Third Party 
Requestor Comments to NFOA, pg. 22 (quoting Jaeger § 7.3) 
(emphasis added). Thus, by Respondent’s own admission, any 
monitoring performed by Jaeger is of requests in the browser 
rather than events in subsystems of the operating system. Thus, 
once again, Respondent and the Examiner (who adopted 
Respondent’s arguments with respect to Jaeger) improperly 
conflate Appellant's claimed “event” and “request.” See Section 
VII.A.2, supra. 

PO App. Br. 14–15; see also PO App. Br. 9 (“Appellant has submitted and 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 4 

continues to submit that ‘an event caused from a request from a 

Downloadable’ should be construed to be an event at the operating system 

level that results from a request from a Downloadable.”); see also PO App. 

Br. Evidence Appendix, Exhibit B, Declaration of Dr. Giovanni Vigna ¶ 43 

(Jaeger “focuses on access right by users and/or groups”); see also PO Reb. 

Br. 8–9. 

 We have considered Patent Owner’s arguments and evidence, and we 

do not see any error in the Examiner’s findings. 

 Claim 22 recites “means for monitoring substantially in parallel a 

plurality of subsystems of the operating system during runtime for an event 

caused from a request made by a Downloadable.”  The ’962 patent describes 

Java class extensions 304 (Figure 3); operating system probes 310, 312, 314, 

and 316 (Figures 3 and 4); and messages extension 404, Dynamic-Data-

Exchange (DDE) extension 405, and Dynamically-Linked-Library (DLL) 

extension 406 (Figure 4). See ’962 patent, col. 4, ll. 10–31; col. 5, ll. 23–38. 

Thus, we conclude the broadest reasonable interpretation of the recited 

“means for monitoring” includes class extensions, probes, and equivalent-

functioning software between an application and the operating system. 

 We agree with and adopt as our own Requester’s explanation: 

Jaeger discloses monitoring events in subsystems in the 
operating system because it discloses monitoring subsystem 
calls. Jaeger describes enforcing access control rights at the level 
of the operating system. See Jaeger, § 7.2. In other words, Jaeger 
describes enforcing access control rights by monitoring calls 
made by a mobile agent (or other downloaded content) to 
operating system resources. Thus, Jaeger discloses the 
“monitoring” limitation of the ’962 patent claims. See, e.g., 
Requester’s Initial Comments filed October 10, 2012 (“Initial 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 5 

Comments”), p. 22. As discussed above, the claims do not 
require monitoring of operating system calls to be performed at 
the operating system level. 

3PR Resp. Br. 13; see also Third-Party Requester Comments after Non-

Final Action, dated October 10, 2012, 22 (Jaeger’s authorization operation 

makes possible only authorized accesses to system objects (citing Jaeger 

§ 7.3)). 

 Put another way, Jaeger (§ 7.2) describes: “Application-specific 

interpreters are responsible for deriving access rights within their domain, 

but the browser still enforces all system object accesses.” Jaeger (§ 7.3) 

describes: “operations are implemented by a call to authorize which checks 

the content access rights prior to calling the actual operation. Since these 

commands are only available in the browser and are protected by the 

authorization operation, only authorized accesses to system objects are 

possible.” Thus, Jaeger describes software between an application and the 

operating system (Jaeger’s browser) for monitoring substantially in parallel a 

plurality of subsystems of the operating system during runtime for an event 

(Jaeger’s enforcing access control rights by monitoring calls made by 

downloaded content to operating system resources) caused from a request 

made by a Downloadable. 

 Regarding Patent Owner’s argument that Jaeger’s monitoring is of 

requests in the browser rather than events in subsystems of the operating 

system, we do not see any error in the Examiner’s findings because claim 22 

does not require monitoring of operating system calls to be performed at the 

operating system level. Jaeger’s browser performs the recited monitoring. 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 6 

 Regarding Patent Owner’s related argument that claim 22 requires an 

event at the operating system level that results from a request from a 

Downloadable, we find this argument without consequence. Jaeger describes 

an event at the operating system level (Jaeger’s accesses to system objects) 

that results from a request from a Downloadable (Jaeger’s call made by 

downloaded content).  

 Regarding Patent Owner’s related evidence of record explaining that 

Jaeger focuses on access rights by users and/or groups, we find this 

explanation without consequence because Jaeger’s browser performs the 

recited monitoring. 

 We, therefore, sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claim 22, as well as 

claims 2, 3, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 32, 34, 35, 40, 43, and 

48–51, which are not argued separately with particularity. 

 

Claims 44, 46, and 47 

 Claim 44, 46, and 47 each recite: “each subsystem includes one of a 

file system, network system, process system or memory system.” 

 Regarding these claims, Patent Owner further argues: “Jaeger fails to 

monitor a plurality of subsystems of an operating system, let alone 

monitoring those subsystems in parallel, let alone each of those subsystems 

including one of a file system, network system, process system, or memory 

system.” PO App. Br. 16; see also PO App. Br. 11 (a plurality of subsystems 

are monitored). 

 We do not see any error in the Examiner’s findings. 

 We agree with and adopt as our own Requester’s explanation: “the 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 7 

broadest reasonable interpretation of claims 44[, 46, and] 47 includes 

monitoring a plurality of subsystems (e.g., 2) wherein each subsystem 

includes 1 type of subsystem.” 3PR Resp. Br. 14; see also Jaeger § 5 (“The 

local system services provide operating systems services for controlling 

operations external to the interpreters. Also, system-specific information is 

made available for local system services (e.g., the file system structure).)”; 

see also Jaeger, § 5, Figure 5 (browser accesses network services, local 

software, local file). 

 Thus, Jaeger describes each subsystem (for example, Jaeger’s network 

service and Jaeger’s local file) includes one of a file system (Jaeger’s local 

file), network system (Jaeger’s network service), process system or memory 

system. 

 We, therefore, sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 44, 46, and 

47. 

 

Claim 53 

 Claim 53 recites: “comparing information pertaining to the 

Downloadable against a predetermined security policy, wherein information 

pertaining to the Downloadable includes information about requests to the 

operating system made by the Downloadable.” 

 Regarding claim 53, Patent Owner further argues: 

Jaeger fails to show or suggest information pertaining to the 
Downloadable including “information about requests to the 
operating system made by the Downloadable.” With respect to 
this feature, Requestor relies on Jaeger’s disclosure of the ability 
to identify I/O commands, which is completely irrelevant to 
whether or not information pertaining to a Downloadable 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 8 

includes information about a request to the operating system, let 
alone information about multiple requests to the operating 
system. 

PO App. Br. 15. 

 We do not see any error in the Examiner’s findings. 

 We agree with and adopt as our own Requester’s explanation: “Jaeger 

discloses comparing information pertaining to the Downloadable against a 

predetermined security policy. For example, the access rights associated 

with executing content constitute a ‘security policy.’” 3PR Resp. Br. 14; see 

also Jaeger § 5 (identifying I/O commands in the content language of the 

downloaded content). 

 We conclude that construing “information pertaining to the 

Downloadable” to include Jaeger’s identified I/O commands is not overly 

broad or unreasonable because the identified I/O commands are part of the 

downloaded content. 

 Thus, Jaeger describes comparing information pertaining to the 

Downloadable (Jaeger’s identified I/O commands) against a predetermined 

security policy (Jaeger’s access rights), wherein information pertaining to 

the Downloadable includes information about requests (Jaeger’s identified 

I/O commands) to the operating system made by the Downloadable. 

 We, therefore, sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claim 53. 

 

Claim 54 

 Claim 54 recites: “comparing information pertaining to the 

downloadable against a predetermined security policy, wherein information 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 9 

pertaining to the Downloadable includes information about memory usage 

by the Downloadable.” 

 Regarding claim 54, Patent Owner further argues: 

Jaeger is completely silent with respect to information pertaining 
to the Downloadable including information about memory usage 
by the Downloadable. Requestor’s reli[es] on Jaeger’s disclosure 
that “[a] process can read and write objects in its memory,” 
which has no bearing on whether information pertaining to a 
Downloadable includes information about memory usage by the 
Downloadable. 

PO App. Br. 15–16. 

 We do not see any error in the Examiner’s findings. 

 Jaeger (§ 3) describes: “[a] process can read and write objects in its 

memory.” Thus, Jaeger’s identified I/O commands include commands for 

reading and writing objects in memory. 

 Thus, Jaeger describes comparing information pertaining to the 

downloadable (Jaeger’s identified I/O commands) against a predetermined 

security policy (Jaeger’s access rights), wherein information pertaining to 

the Downloadable includes information about memory usage by the 

Downloadable (Jaeger’s commands for reading and writing objects in 

memory). 

 We, therefore, sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claim 54. 

 

THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION OF CLAIMS 11, 32, AND 43 OVER JAEGER 

 The Examiner finds claims 11, 32, and 43 are invalid under 35 U.S.C. 

§ 103(a) as obvious over Jaeger. RAN 15, 44–45, 67 (incorporating Request 

63 and Claim Chart Exhibit C1 by reference). Claims 11, 32, and 43 each 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 10 

recite: “wherein the predetermined responsive action includes discarding the 

Downloadable.” 

 Patent Owner presents the following principal arguments: 

 i. The Examiner provides no support for the assertion that the 

claimed invention would have been obvious. PO App. Br. 25; PO Reb. Br. 

11–12. 

 ii. Endrijonas (Endrijonas, “Rx PC: The Anti-Virus Handbook,” 

McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1993) is not included in the ground of rejection. PO App. 

Br. 25. 

 iii. The Examiner does not explain why it would have been 

obvious to combine Jaeger and Endrijonas. PO App. Br. 25. 

 We have considered Patent Owner’s arguments and evidence, and we 

do not see any error in the Examiner’s findings. 

 We agree with and adopt as our own Requester’s explanation: “one of 

ordinary skill in the art would have recognized that modifying Jaeger to 

discard the executable content would provide more efficient memory 

allocation by freeing memory space previously taken by the executable 

content for other uses.” 3PR Resp. Br. 18; see also Jaeger § 7.3 (“In general, 

software execution is authorized by determining if the remote principal (i.e., 

principal group) has execute rights for the first argument in the exec call. If 

so, then the exec operation executes the software using the current rights of 

the principal group”). 

 Regarding Patent Owners argument i, Jaeger (§ 7.3) discloses 

executing external software with an exec call when authorized. When not 

authorized, the exec call in the Downloadable is not executed.  A skilled 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 11 

artisan would have recognized that as an alternative to not executing the 

exec call in the Downloadable, it would have been obvious to discard the 

Downloadable for the purpose of freeing memory space. See Request Claim 

Chart Exhibit C1. 

 Regarding Patent Owner’s arguments ii and iii, the claims are rejected 

based on Jaeger. We agree with Requester that the recited discarding would 

have been obvious in view of Jaeger alone, for reasons explained above. 

Endrijonas provides evidence that discarding or deleting is well-known. See 

Endrijonas 73. 

 We, therefore, sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 11, 32, and 

43. 

 

THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION OF CLAIMS 4, 14, 25, AND 36 OVER JAEGER AND 

CHAPPELL 

 The Examiner finds claims 4, 14, 25, and 36 are invalid under 35 

U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious over Jaeger and Chappell (David Chappell, 

“Understanding ActiveX and OLE, A Guide for Developers & Managers” 

Microsoft Press, 1996). RAN 16, 48–49, 69–70 (incorporating Request 40 

and Claim Chart Exhibit C1 by reference).  

 Patent Owner argues that claims 4, 14, 25, and 36 are patentable for 

their dependency from a patentable base claim. PO App. Br. 26. 

 Claim 4 depends from withdrawn base claim 1, claim 14 depends 

from withdrawn base claim 12, claim 25 depends from base claim 22, and 

claim 36 depends from withdrawn base claim 33. 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 12 

 We sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 4, 14, 25, and 36 for 

reasons discussed above with respect to claim 22. 

 

THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION OF CLAIMS 7, 9, 10, 17, 20, 28, 30, 31, 39, 41, 

AND 42 OVER JAEGER AND RASMUSSON 

 The Examiner finds claims 7, 9, 10, 17, 20, 28, 30, 31, 39, 41, and 42 

are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious over Jaeger and Rasmusson 

(Andreas Rasmusson & Sverker Jansson, “Personal Security Assistance for 

Secure Internet Commerce,” NEW SECURITY PARADIGMS ’96 

Workshop, Lake Arrowhead, CA, September 16–19, 1996). RAN 16, 49–50, 

70 (incorporating Request 40–41 and Claim Chart Exhibit C1 by reference).  

 Patent Owner argues that claims 7, 9, 10, 17, 20, 28, 30, 31, 39, 41, 

and 42 are patentable for their dependency from a patentable base claim. PO 

App. Br. 26. 

 Claims 7, 9, and 10 depends from withdrawn base claim 1, claims 17 

and 20 depend from withdrawn base claim 12, claims 28, 20, and 31 depend 

from base claim 22, and claims 39, 41, and 42 depend from withdrawn base 

claim 33. 

 We sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 7, 9, 10, 17, 20, 28, 30, 

31, 39, 41, and 42 for reasons discussed above with respect to claim 22. 

 

THE REMAINING REJECTIONS 

 Because we have affirmed the Examiner’s rejection of all the claims, 

we decline to reach the merits of the remaining rejections over the prior art.  

See, e.g., In re Gleave, 560 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (not reaching 



Appeal 2015-007907 
Reexamination Control 95/001,836 
Patent 6,480,962 B1 
 

 13 

rejections based on obviousness when claims already rejected as 

anticipated).   

 

ORDER 

The Examiner’s decision rejecting claims 2–4, 7–11, 13, 14, 16–20, 

22–32, 34–36, 39–44, 46–51, 53, and 54 is affirmed. 

Requests for extensions of time in this inter partes reexamination 

proceeding are governed by 37 C.F.R. § 1.956.  See 37 C.F.R. § 41.79. 

In the event neither party files a request for rehearing within the time 

provided in 37 C.F.R. § 41.79, and this decision becomes final and 

appealable under 37 C.F.R. § 41.81, a party seeking judicial review must 

timely serve notice on the Director of the United States Patent and 

Trademark Office. See 37 C.F.R. §§ 90.1 and 1.983.
